# Volcano Hunter v1.0

Volcano Hunter is a machine learning pipeline for detecting volcanic eruptions in ice core sulfate records. This repository provides a simplified, reproducible version of the workflow, aimed at demonstrating the core structure of the model using publicly available data.



## Overview

This pipeline processes raw ice core chemistry data, constructs sliding windows around each year, extracts morphological features, and trains an XGBoost classifier to identify volcanic events. It then compares predicted events with a benchmark catalog of known eruptions.

## How to Use

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare EDC dataset

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_EDC_for_ML.py
```

### 3. Generate ML windows

```bash
python scripts/generate_ml_windows.py
```

### 4. Extract features

```bash
python scripts/extract_features_from_windows.py
```

### 5. Train the model

```bash
python scripts/train_xgboost_model.py
```

### 6. Predict and match with catalog

```bash
python scripts/predict_prob_from_saved_model.py
python scripts/match_ml_predictions_with_catalog.py
```
